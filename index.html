      <h2>The Early History of Sumerian Cats</h2>
      <p>
        We all love cats, but what about those cats roaming in the city of Girsu?
        What about cats that know how design algorithms?
      </p>
      <p>
        While not as famously deified as they were in ancient Egypt, cats in
        Sumer still held a special place in day-to-day life. They protected
        grain supplies from rodents and became symbols of grace and poise in
        numerous Sumerian artifacts. In clay tablets and early cuneiform
        scripts, there are mentions of temple cats dedicated to certain
        deities known for fertility and agriculture.

      <h2>Sumerian Mythology & Feline Symbolism</h2>
      <p>
        Within the pantheon of Sumerian gods and goddesses, some held dominion
        over nature and creatures of the land. Cats, being agile and elusive,
        were sometimes associated with mysticism and protection. Legends
        suggest that certain temple guardians were guided by the spirit of
        these cats, which were believed to keep evil spirits at bay.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although the records on direct cat worship remain sparse, references
        to protective feline spirits appear in myths surrounding fertility
        rites and harvest celebrations. Several cuneiform tablets depict cats
        alongside wheat sheaves or near altars, suggesting their vital role in
        safeguarding the livelihood of the Sumerian people.
